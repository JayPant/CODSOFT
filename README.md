## Overview

This repository showcases various data science tasks, demonstrating the application of machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. Each task includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, and evaluation. The objective is to gain practical experience and a deep understanding of the data science workflow.

## Task 1: Titanic Survival Prediction

### Objective

Build a model to predict whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not using the Titanic dataset. This classic beginner project involves predicting survival based on features like age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, etc.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Load the dataset from Kaggle.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and drop irrelevant features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data to understand survival rates across different features.
4. **Model Building**: Train a Random Forest classifier to predict survival.
5. **Model Tuning**: Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.
6. **Evaluation**: Assess model performance using accuracy and classification report.

## Task 2: Movie Rating Prediction with Python

### Objective

Predict movie ratings using a machine learning model. The dataset includes user ratings for different movies, and the goal is to predict future ratings.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Load the dataset from a reliable source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and encode categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the distribution of ratings and user preferences.
4. **Model Building**: Use collaborative filtering techniques like Matrix Factorization.
5. **Model Tuning**: Optimize the model for better accuracy.
6. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like RMSE to evaluate model performance.

## Task 3: Iris Flower Classification

### Objective

Classify iris flowers into three species based on their features using the Iris dataset. This is a fundamental machine learning task for beginners.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Load the Iris dataset from sklearn datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Ensure data is clean and ready for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize the data to understand feature distributions.
4. **Model Building**: Train a Logistic Regression model to classify the flowers.
5. **Model Tuning**: Optimize the model using cross-validation.
6. **Evaluation**: Use accuracy and confusion matrix to assess performance.

## Task 4: Sales Prediction using Python

### Objective

Predict future sales using historical sales data. This task involves forecasting techniques to help businesses plan their inventory and marketing strategies.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Load the sales data from a reliable source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and engineer features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze sales trends and seasonality.
4. **Model Building**: Use time series forecasting models like ARIMA or Prophet.
5. **Model Tuning**: Optimize the model for better forecasting accuracy.
6. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like MAE and RMSE to evaluate model performance.

## Task 5: Credit Card Fraud Detection

### Objective

Detect fraudulent credit card transactions using a machine learning model. The dataset includes transactions labeled as fraudulent or not.

### Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Load the credit card transaction dataset.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle class imbalance, clean the data, and encode categorical variables.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the data to understand the distribution of fraudulent transactions.
4. **Model Building**: Train a Random Forest classifier to detect fraud.
5. **Model Tuning**: Optimize the model using GridSearchCV and handle class imbalance with techniques like SMOTE.
6. **Evaluation**: Use precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate model performance.
